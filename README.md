Now you can make BBCode thats just pixel art for branches!!! GDNacho shall be IMPRESSED!

# How does it work?

First off you choose your image, preferably PNG but it works with webp too. (Works best with 16x16 in width and height!)

Then tap convert image and you get your BB code!

Go to your branches level in the levels folder find where your speaker box text is and replace it with the input, if it isn't red (in the tool) then it should be good to go! Make sure it's high enough to see the full thing!

# Why did you make this?

Because there was none that was public, nor open source!
